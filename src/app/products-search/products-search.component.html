        not products. The $ is a convention that indicates products$ is an Observable, not an array 
        Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, use the pipe character (|) followed by async.
        This identifies Angular's AsyncPipe and subscribes to an Observable automatically 
        so you won't have to do so in the component class.
